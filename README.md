This repository contains a collection of ECU (Engine Control Unit) and TCU (Transmission Control Unit) binary files (.bin), along with their corresponding definition files (.xdf) used for tuning and analysis.

The files are organized into two main categories:

Base: Original, unmodified factory files.

Modified: Tuned or optimized versions of the base files.

This repository contains a structured collection of ECU (Engine Control Unit) and TCU (Transmission Control Unit) binary files (.bin), along with their corresponding definition files (.xdf) for tuning, comparison, and educational purposes.

Files are organized hierarchically to support multiple vehicle manufacturers and models. The folder structure follows this format:
Manufacturer/Model/Chassis/EngineCode/VIN/
├── ECU/
│   ├── Base/
│   └── Modified/
└── TCU/
    ├── Base/
    └── Modified/

Example:
BMW/3/E46/330i/WBA123456789/
├── ECU/
│   ├── Base/        # Original factory ECU binaries and .xdf files
│   └── Modified/    # Tuned or modified versions
└── TCU/
    ├── Base/
    └── Modified/

This structure ensures consistency and makes it easy to add support for additional vehicles, such as:
Seat/Leon/1P/1.8TSI/VSS123456789/

Contribution Guidelines:
Follow the folder hierarchy exactly as described above.

Include both .bin and matching .xdf files whenever possible.

Use full VINs or anonymized placeholders (e.g., VIN123...) if privacy is a concern.
